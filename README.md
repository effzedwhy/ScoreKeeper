# ScoreKeeper 

One of my first projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

1) You input a number for the winning score.
2) The player who reaches the winning score wins.
3) Resent button to reset the scores and winning score.
4) Default winning score is set to 5.
5) Later, I added text and colour to show who the winner is.

I initially made the app back in 2019 and therefore made some updates, added some features and changed the var to let.
